### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | =610Hz | =360Hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | = 470KHz| = 270KHz|
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 489.39KHz\) | \( BW = f'h - f'l =269.64KHz \) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 12.88\) | \( A'{v(mid)} =8.40 \) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |9.10  |  5.63|

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
