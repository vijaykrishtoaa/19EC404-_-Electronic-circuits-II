## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:
S.No	Parameters	Without Feedback	With Feedback
1	Lower cut-off frequency	0.28kHz	0.24kHz
2	Upper cut-off frequency	1.4MHz	2.7MHz
3	Bandwidth	( BW = fh - fl = 1.39MHz )	( BW = f'h - f'l = 2.6MHz)
4	Mid-band Gain	( A{v(mid)} = 21)	( A'{v(mid)} =17.04 )
5	Gain at half power point	14.84	12.08
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
